# Vendor Invoice Document Automation with Gen AI

**Overview**  
Our Vendor Invoice Management solution, developed by NexGen Technologies, leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way businesses handle invoice processing and fraud detection. Designed to automate the extraction and validation of data from vendor invoices, it ensures accuracy and security while significantly reducing manual effort.

**Description**  
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, our system extracts key information from invoices, such as dates, amounts, vendor details, and terms. It then validates this information against predefined rules and checks for discrepancies that might indicate fraudulent activities. Integrations such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Knowledge Graph, Hyper Augmented Generation, and custom instruction tuning refine the accuracy of data extraction and validation, ensuring robustness and reliability.

**Key Technologies Used**
- **Advanced RAG with Knowledge Graph**: Enhances the retrieval of accurate data by cross-verifying interconnected data nodes.
- **Hyper Augmented Generation**: Uses advanced algorithms for predictive model improvement.
- **Custom Instruction Tuning**: Adapts the AI model to execute specific invoice processing tasks.
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Specializes the language model in invoice-related terminologies.
